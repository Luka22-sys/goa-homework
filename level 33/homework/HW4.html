    <h1>Level 33: Understanding Margin and Padding</h1>
    <p><strong>Margin:</strong> Think of it as the outer space around an element. It creates a distance between the element and other surrounding elements. If you have a box and you want to push it away from other boxes or content around it, you use margin.</p>
    <p><strong>Padding:</strong> This is the space inside an element, between the content and the border of the box. If you have a box with text inside, padding will push the text away from the edges of the box, making it look less crowded.</p>
